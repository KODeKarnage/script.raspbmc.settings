CHANGELOG:
Changed label in Settings from "Keep RaspBMC Updated" to "Update RaspBMC on Reboot"
Options in Settings now "Always (Notify)"(default), "Never", or "Notify Only"
'Always (Notify)" is auto-update on reboot (with notification, as I figured no-one would want to be surprised by the update)
'Never' is never auto-update
'Notify Only' is never auto-update, but let me know when a new version is available
Added update_notify.py to resources/lib, containing the update notification service class
Added service to autostart.py (autostart will now continue to run instead of dying)
changed switches.py to launch or kill service without needing restart
bumped version number
